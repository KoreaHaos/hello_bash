# A hello_bash Repo

If you have no idea what [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is, you'd be better off starting [here](http://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial) or [here](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-1.html).

This is a collection of bash scripting examples i'd like to eventually turn into a hello_world but currently i am just using it to learn bash!

Happy coding!
